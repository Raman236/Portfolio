# Capstone Project 2.3 - Data Visualization
For this project, I had to apply both data analytics and visualisation skills to a real-life data set of my choice. And I found online (https://data.code4sa.org/) the 2016 Matric Reports dataset which I explored in this project.

I looked into the affects of different quintile schools on student performance, and number of students affecting pass rates. I would have gone deeper if there where more data in terms of school funding, facilities, and social economic data.

- **Achievements:**
  - Explored the Dataset rasing some key questions
  - Reported on the information gained

- **What I learnt:**
  - How to clean data from online
    - improve numpy and pandas skills
    - dealing with duplicate rows using other research techniques
  - Explore data
    - use matplotlib and seaborn plotting libraries
    - generate catplots, bar graphs, boxplots, jointplots, scatter plots
    - apply statistical reasoning
  - Report writing of explored data
