# Capstone Project 3.1 - Image Processing (MNIST Dataset) using Machine Learning
For this Project i be built an image recognition classifier that accurately determines the house number displayed in images from Google Street. The dataset is from Stanford
University (http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers). It contains images of house numbers taken from Google Street View. Each one has been cropped to 32Ã—32 pixels in size, focused on just the number.

- **Achievements:**
  - Generated a Machine Learning Model to classify images as numerical data
  - Used two classifers Logistic Regression and Random Forest

- **What I learnt:**
  - split data into training and test
  - use Logistic regression and Random Forests to classify images numerically
  - Tune model parameters
  - generate confusion matrices
  - Report on the accuracy and precision, recall and f1 scores
