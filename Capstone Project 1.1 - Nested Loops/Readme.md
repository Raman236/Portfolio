# Capstone Project 1.1 - Nested Loops
This was my very first capstone project I had done, and I was very much worried, but I loved every minute of it. Just sitting down, with a pen and paper trying to figure out the algorithm, well...actually that was supposed to be the boring part, but in fact it was exciting. Exciting to know that I am planning something algorithmically on paper which I will soon implement in REAL CODE afterwards. To me this was thrilling and exciting as I have always loved to go into programming, but the fear that you would not meet up to those hackery expections were daunting. Well..here I am now, writting my first piece of code.

The project was to take all that I have learnt previously and consolidate the knowledge and experience and apply that to nested loops.

## Prime Number Checker
This program takes in an interger from the user and checks if the entered number is a prime number checking that it is divisible by **1 and itself ONLY**. <br>
Count keeps track of how many numbers (from 2 to the entered number) can divide the entered number with no remainders. And thus the count value of 2 indicates that the integer is a prime number, and anything above that is not.

#### Output
Please enter an integer:  10<br>
10 is NOT a Prime Number

## Tritable
This program prints out a triangular timetable

1 <br>
2 4 <br>
3 6 9 <br>
4 8 12 16 <br>
5 10 15 20 25 <br>
6 12 18 24 30 36 <br>
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 <br>
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 <br>
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81
