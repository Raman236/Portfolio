# Capstone Project 1.1 - Nested Loops
This was my very first capstone project I had done, and I was very much worried, but I loved every minute of it. Just sitting down, with a pen and paper trying to figure out the algorithm, well...actually that was the boring part, but exciting. Exciting to know that I am planning something algorithmically on paper which I will soon implement in REAL CODE afterwards. To me this was thrilling and exciting as I have always loved to go into programming, but the fear that you would not meet up to those hackery expections were daunting. Well..here I am now, writting my first piece of code.

## Prime
This program takes in an interger from the user and checks if the entered number is a prime number checking that it is divisible by **1 and itself ONLY**. <br>
Count keeps track of how many numbers (from 2 to the entered number) can divide the entered number with no remainders. And thus the count value of 2 indicates that the integer is a prime number, and anything above that is not.

## Tritable
This program prints out "*" as a triangular table
