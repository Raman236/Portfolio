# Capstone Project 3.3 - Sentiment Analysis NLP RNN
This Capstone Project was about a basic form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called Sentiment Analysis. I was required to use two different neural networks in Keras to try and classify a book review as either positive or negative, and report on which network type worked better.

- **Achievements:**
  - Generated a Machine Learning Model to classify negative and positive reviews from text data
  - Used Keras in developing Recurrent Neural Network

- **What I learnt:**
  - Preprocess Text data for machine learning using NLP
  - Build a Keras model
  - Train the model with various layers and parameters
  - Test the model
  - Make predictions
