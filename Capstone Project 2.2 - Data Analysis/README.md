# Capstone Project 2.2 - Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial component of data science which allows one to understand the basics of what your data looks like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them. So for this task, we had to clean, sanitise and explore our data using the Automobile dataset.

Once this was done in the jupyter notebook, a report was written discussing the data that was explored

- **Achievements:**
  - Explored the Automobiles
  - Reported on the information gained

- **What I learnt:**
  - How to clean data
    - use numpy and pandas
    - identify redundant columns
    - visualize missing data
    - convert columns datatype to the appropriate datatype
    - dealing with duplicate rows/data
    - dealing with date columns and extracting them appropriately
  - Explore data
    - use matplotlib and seaborn plotting libraries
    - generate catplots, bar graphs, boxplots, jointplots, scatter plots
    - apply statistical reasoning
  - Report writing of explored data
