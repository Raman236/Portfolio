# Capstone Project 2.1 - Bookstore Database Management System
This project was a way to test my programming skills and applying my knowledge in order to create software to meet the unique specifications that a client may want.

The project required me to create a program for a bookstore to allow the clerk to enter data about new books into the database, update book information, delete books from the database and search to find the availability of books in the database.

I used Object Oriented Programming and SQLite to make this program

- **Achievements:**
  - created a bookstore program
  - Query and Update database using SQLite
  - that utilizes an external database to store information
  - Database update and add information

- **What I learnt:**
  - How OOP can be used to run the same task without writing the same code (Pythons Modular Approach)
  - How to use SQL in python using SQLite module
  - How to effectively manage and update a database from Python program
