# Capstone Project 3.2 - Unsupervised Machine Learning
For this Capstone project, I performed clustering techniques on the US Arrests dataset and analyse which method is the best. Secondly, I performed PCA on the dataset to investigate if it helps the clustering of the observations.

This dataset is from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge. A description of the data is given as: “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.”

Then Created a report on the data explored

- **Achievements:**
  - Applied Principal Component Analysis Techniques
  - Applied Hierarchical Clustering technique

- **What I learnt:**
  - split data into training and test
  - use Logistic regression and Random Forests to classify images numerically
  - Tune model parameters
  - generate confusion matrices
  - Report on the accuracy and precision, recall and f1 scores
